# QA Role Questions

**Some of those questions are vague on purpose and their interpretation is up to you.**

**The format of how you provide the answers will also be taken into account.**

1) Please describe what were the most common bugs you have found in web applications you were working with (desktop only)

- all sorts of 4xx and 5xx HTTP errors
- not working links/buttons
- missing content

2) Please describe what were the most common bugs you have found in mobile applications you were working with (native mobile apps)

- layout misplacement
- API communication errors
- integration with phone problems

3) What is your usual process of reporting bugs to developers ?

- make sure that bug is valid (also in collaboration with developers)
- create bug report (comprehensive title, initial conditions, steps to reproduce, expected and actual result, logs, screenshots)
- prioritize bug, if necessary escalate it

4) How did your day look like in your recent QA related role ?

- morning stand-up with developers and product owners
- manually testing stories if any were ready to test
- regression testing bugs, if there where any fixes
- writing automated tests for tests cases

5) What problems have you experienced during your collaboration with developers ?

- differently understood requirements
- lack of proper, documented communication

6) What are the top 3 types of bugs which are the most annoying / problematic ?

- lack of basic accessibility of a web page (e.g. while using only keyboard)
- bad UX design

7) What was the most critical bug that you have found ?

It was a security bug, which enabled attacker to switch parameters sent to the server. And on the backend side the parameters weren't validated. Money were involved in the application basic functionality.

8) How do you prefer to receive feedback from the development team ?

If it's bug/story/feature related I prefer to have all decisions to be in the correlating item in CI/CD system

9) Which technical areas are you interested in ?

- web accessibility
- financial technology
- blockchain technology
- IoT technology

10) Which tools / apps do you use when debugging apps (you can list anything that makes your life easier)

- Visual Studio
- Fiddler
- Chrome developer tools
- MS SQL ManagementStudio

11) How do you deal with regression testing ? (this question is vague on purpose)

- may ask the developer what modules/areas he/she touched
- based on that make a list which other functionalities may be affected
- check data combination different from bug report

12) Assuming that you were the head of a 4 people QA team, how would you organise everything ?

- Daily stand-ups to check progress of the work
- Team test planning at the begging of each development cycle
- Test summary at the end of the cycle

13) How would you optimise QA processes in your previous roles ?

- On a long project I would have putted more pressure on automating all test cases. From the moment of creation of the story
- Developers should collaborate with testers in creating Test Cases, before or during development process

14) How do you deal with maintenance issues in a QA team ? (this question is ambiguous on purpose)

I'm believer in living documentation, either Test Stories, Test Cases or Automation Test Scripts.
Everything should be updated according to the current state of the system. That should be done by development team, including tester, developers and product owners.

15) If you were to give me an advice about how to approach QA in general , what would it be ?

Every system has bugs. Everybody makes mistakes. Don't assume anything.

16) Why did you chose a QA Engineer role ?

I'm passionate about informational technology. I always wanted to create software. Development wasn't my strongest side, but I discovered that I'm good at quality audit.
So my fantasy was fulfilled :)

17) What are the biggest problems / challenges that you see in a role of a QA Engineer ?

Routine.

18) How would you solve the problems / challenges from the previous question ?

Change role once in a while.

19) Assuming that you suddenly need to decide between 5 major features / project in terms of what should be a priority for QA and there is no one to ask for a priority list, how would you chose a single feature / project to test over the next few days and based on what ? (describe you logic behind it)

I would check where the money is. What feature/project has the most users and how valuable they are to the stakeholder.

20) What else would you like to tell me ? :)

I'm looking forward to work in English speaking environment :)
